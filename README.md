# Sampling Methods in Numpy

This repository contains code for some basic sampling methods implemented using numpy.    

The following methods are implemented with examples

* Importance Sampling (Univariate example)
* Rejection Sampling (Univariate example)
* Metropolis-Hastings (Univariate and Multivariate example)
* Gibbs Sampling (Multivariate example)
* Langevin Monte Carlo
  * Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA)
  * Metropolis-adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA)
* Inverse Transform Sampling
  * Cauchy Distribution
  * Exponential Distribution
  * Gumbel Distribution
