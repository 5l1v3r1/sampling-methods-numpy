# Bayesian-Scribbles
This repository contains code that I scribble while learning PGMs & Bayesian Inference. 
This will roughly follow Sir David MacKay's [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCiZc0n6COY&list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6)
on Information Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks. Another great resource to read about some of the stuff 
in this repository is [Stefano Ermon's notes](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/).    

The repository currently contains
* Monte Carlo Methods [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_0iGWcyLI)]
